# --- Placeholder for Buttons (Less standard for multi-page navigation) ---
# While requested, Streamlit's primary navigation is the sidebar.
# Adding buttons here that *don't* navigate can be confusing.
# Instead, we clearly instruct the user to use the sidebar above.
# If you absolutely wanted buttons, they would typically trigger actions
# *on this page* or potentially use session state hacks to switch pages,
# which is usually less clean than the built-in sidebar.

# Example of how you *might* add non-functional buttons for visual cue:
# st.write("---")
# st.write("Quick Access (Use Sidebar for Navigation):")
# col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
# with col1:
#     st.button("Go to Interest Calculator", disabled=True, help="Use sidebar navigation")
# with col2:
#     st.button("Go to Loan Calculator", disabled=True, help="Use sidebar navigation")


st.info("üëà Use the navigation menu on the left to select a calculator!")

st.caption("Built with Streamlit.")
